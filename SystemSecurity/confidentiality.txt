Confidentiality
Confidentiality ensures that data remains private in three different
situations: when it is at rest, when it is in transit, and when it is in use.
Confidentiality is perhaps the most widely cited goal of cryptosystems
—the preservation of secrecy for stored information or for
communications between individuals and groups. Two main types of
cryptosystems enforce confidentiality:
Symmetric cryptosystems use a shared secret key available to all
users of the cryptosystem.
Asymmetric cryptosystems use individual combinations of public
and private keys for each user of the system. Both of these
concepts are explored in the section “Modern Cryptography
” later
in this chapter.
