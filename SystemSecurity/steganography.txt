Steganography
Steganography is the art of using cryptographic techniques to embed
secret messages within another file. Steganographic algorithms work
by making alterations to the least significant bits of the many bits that
make up image files. The changes are so minor that there is no
appreciable effect on the viewed image. This technique allows
communicating parties to hide messages in plain sightâ€”for example,
they might embed a secret message within an illustration on an
otherwise innocent web page.
